# custom-pascals-triangle
Simulate your own Pascal's triangle

## Custom rulesets and starting conditions
Instead of adding, the numbers can be multiplied, or subtracted.  
The number on top doesn't have to be a 1; in this simulator you can put different ones and see new patterns emerge.

## Visualize
Automatically color the numbers depending on how large they are
